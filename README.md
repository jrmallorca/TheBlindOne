# TheBlindOne
(Unfinished) A summer text-based game project dedicated on learning more about MVC design pattern, JavaFX and unit testing through JUnit.

(If you need to quit the program after running it, please do it through Alt+F4 unless presented with the quit game option in the 
menu)

**Currently implemented**:
- **Menu:** Start a new game, look at the controls or quit the game.
- **Character Creation:** Name your character in an alpha numeric format.
- **Cutscene:** After character creation, a little cutscene shows before proceeding to the main game
(currently non-existent).
- **Tests:** Each scene is tested to ensure a properly functioning program.

**Need to implement:**
- **Combat:** The combat would be like a text-based version of For Honor's combatâ€”reaction based
and timed.
- **Enemies**
